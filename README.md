## Welcome to B00kMaRKr

This is a demonstration app to utilize some basic asynchronous functionality in Javascript.  After 24 hours data will be purged, but until then B00kMaRKr will record a list of favorite web URLs along with ratings and descriptions.


## USER STORIES

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

- title
- url link
- description
- rating (1-5)
- I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required).

I can select from a dropdown (a `<select>` element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
